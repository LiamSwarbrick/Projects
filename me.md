TODO: Focus on graphics programming, since focus more on depth than bredth in the indepth sections

I'm currently in third year at University of Leeds studying Meng/Bsc Computer Science with High Performance Computer Graphics and Games Engineering.

Currently programming a voxel game in C, OpenGL 4.5, Win32API.

2D Platformer in C:
- custom sprite animation integrated with the Aseprite pixelart program for simple fun art pipeline. (including loading collision shapes from .aseprite file).
- integrated tilemap editor, serialising levels with json.


Wrote .obj file loader to convert models to GPU ready vertex dump format.
Wrote compiler for Java esque language 'Jack', compiling to hack computer virtual machine instructions.
