Cave story / Undertale vibes but with real time combat Link To The Past like combat.

Dungeons are rogue-like Enter the gungeon style places.

So like Link Between Worlds / LTTP overworld and towns,
but the actual dungeons are like Enter the Gungeon,
And character story like Undertale.

Undertale story has great pacing, make sure to pace story and gameplay.


// Dungeons are like enter the gungeon survive multiple floors like places
// in rogue like fasion
// However they are not procedually generated so can be designed cool.
